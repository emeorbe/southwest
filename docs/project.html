                        <p class="project_text">The great enigma of Spanish and Portuguese is the enormous complexity
                            in the system of pronouns of address throughout their geographical areas.
                            Despite the amount of studies that have analysed the usage of the different
                            alternatives, it is still unknown why this feature has prompted three main
                            regions that are not even individually homogeneous. The Atlantic Ocean
                            emerges as the boundary that splits the American and the European realities,
                            but the south-western area of the Iberian Peninsula shows a mixed system
                            that combines characteristics of both of them. The literature agrees in
                            pinpointing a conjoint evolution in the Hispanic and Lusophone world, but
                            everything changes in the 1700’s.</p>

                            <p class="project_text">The War of Spanish Succession (1700-1714) resulted in the overthrow of
                                the Habsburgs and the new reign of the Bourbons. Their establishment in
                                the Hispanic world marked the beginning of France as the centre of prestige
                                for the entire country as well as the gradual decay of the southwest as
                                a hub between America and Europe. By the early 19th century, the American
                                possessions declared independence and Madrid became the focus of prestige
                                within Spain. The same applies to Portugal, which lost Brazil, fostered
                                Lisbon as the epicentre of prestige and encouraged the colonisation of
                                Africa.</p>

                        <p class="project_text">The late 18th century and the early 19th century attested profound changes
                            in society as a result of two very important events: the Industrial Revolution
                            and the French Revolution. The former provoked the exodus from the countryside
                            to the city and the emergence of the middle class; the latter changed the
                            beliefs of western societies and the way people had to address each other.
                            Politeness started to favour solidarity and to gradually dismiss hierarchy
                            and deference. Simultaneously, western countries promoted the creation
                            of standard languages, prompting a type of diglossia between standard and
                            vernacular, urban and rural, literate and illiterate…</p>
                        <p class="project_text">All these happenings materialised at the same time as America and the
                            Iberian Peninsula followed different political paths. Nevertheless, the
                            southwest maintained the secular relationships that had linked it to the
                            other side of the Atlantic although it began to look at elsewhere within
                            Iberia. The 1700’s and 1800’s witnessed the decline of the southwest after
                            centuries of prestige, the reciprocal isolation between the Hispanic and
                            Lusophone Atlantic shores, besides the creation of three macro-areas embodied
                            in the system of forms of address. But, above all, the 18th and 19th centuries
                            represented the time period in which the south-western Sprachbund ended
                            up establishing itself as an own region that has exhibited both American
                            and European linguistic features until the present being.</p>
                        <p class="project_text">This project aims to find the geographical, sociological, political, pragmatic
                            and grammatical patterns that favoured the emergence and later establishment
                            of the south-western Sprachbund. In order to do so, I will research data
                            that account for the evolution of the system of forms of address in the
                            18th and 19th centuries in western Andalusia and southern Portugal. My
                            investigation will shed light on the likely influence of the other Ibero-Romance
                            languages and the mutual conditioning of Portuguese and Spanish, but it
                            will also determine whether the New World and the south-western Sprachbund
                            have influenced one another despite the American independences or either
                            of them has taken the lead over the other.</p>
                        <p class="project_text">I invite you to dive into the complexity of politeness and forms of address,
                            because they reflect much more than a simple strategy to treat someone:
                            they hide the way a society thinks, they hint at geopolitical relationships,
                            they reveal our beliefs.</p>
