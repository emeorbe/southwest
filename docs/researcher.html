                            <p class="researcher_text personalText">I am a researcher specialised in Ibero-Romance dialectology. My PhD dealt
                                with the diachronic evolution of the system of plural pronouns of address
                                in the south-west of the Iberian Peninsula during the 20th century until
                                now. My career has led me to Switzerland, Portugal and Italy, but it is
                                Spain where I have carried out most of my investigation.</p>
                            <p class="researcher_text personalText">My academic interests range from geography up to linguistics, but it is
                                the combination of both of them the true focus of my research. As a result,
                                I have published many studies that show the geolinguistic distribution
                                and the historical evolution of a number of Ibero-Romance phenomena that
                                have been disregarded in the scientific literature.</p>

                        <p class="researcher_text">The main breakthroughs of my investigations are the result of specific
                            fieldwork throughout the Iberian Peninsula. However, I am specially interested
                            in the south-western part of Iberia, since it has created a Sprachbund
                            that represents an intermediate stage between the reality of America and
                            that of Spain and Portugal.</p>
                        <p class="researcher_text">The project I present here means a turning point in my career and it aims
                            to disseminate the linguistic, geographical, social and pragmatic dynamics
                            that developed during the 18 th and 19 th centuries in the only area that
                            possesses both American and European features. In the months to come, I
                            will show the birth of the so-called Sprachbund as well as the creation
                            of two distinguished areas on both sides of the Hispanic and Lusophone
                            Atlantic, with the southwest as the epicentre of it all.</p>
