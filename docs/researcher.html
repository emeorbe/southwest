                            <p class="researcher_text personalText">I am a researcher specialised in Ibero-Romance dialectology. My PhD dealt
                                with the diachronic evolution of the system of plural pronouns of address
                                in the south-west of the Iberian Peninsula during the 20th century until
                                day. My career has led me to Switzerland, Portugal and Italy, but it is
                                Spain where I have carried out most of my investigation.</p>
                            <p class="researcher_text personalText">My academic interests range from Geography all the way to Linguistics,
                                but it is the combination of these two fields that is the true focus of
                                my research. As a result, I have published many studies that show the geolinguistic
                                distribution and the historical evolution of a number of Ibero-Romance
                                phenomena that have been disregarded in the scientific literature.</p>

                        <p class="researcher_text">The main breakthroughs of my investigations are the result of specific
                            fieldwork throughout the Iberian Peninsula. However, I am especially interested
                            in the south-western part of Iberia, since it has created a <span style="font-style: italic;">Sprachbund</span> that
                            represents an intermediate stage between the reality of America and that
                            of Spain and Portugal.</p>
                        <p class="researcher_text">The project I present here represents a turning point in my career and
                            it aims to disseminate the linguistic, geographical, social and pragmatic
                            dynamics that developed during the 18th and 19th centuries in the only
                            area that possesses both American and European features. In the months
                            to come, I will show the birth of the so-called Sprachbund as well as the
                            formation of two clearly distinguishable areas on both sides of the Hispanic
                            and Lusophone Atlantic, with the southwest as the epicentre of it all.</p>
