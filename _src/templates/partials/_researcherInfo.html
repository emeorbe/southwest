        I am a researcher specialised in Ibero-Romance dialectology. My PhD dealt with the diachronic evolution of the system of plural pronouns of address in the south-west of the Iberian Peninsula during the 20th century until day. My career has led me to Switzerland, Portugal and Italy, but it is Spain where I have carried out most of my investigation.

          My academic interests range from Geography all the way to Linguistics, but it is the combination of these two fields that is the true focus of my research. As a result, I have published many studies that show the geolinguistic distribution and the historical evolution of a number of Ibero-Romance phenomena that have been disregarded in the scientific literature.

          The main breakthroughs of my investigations are the result of specific fieldwork throughout the Iberian Peninsula. However, I am especially interested in the south-western part of Iberia, since it has created a <span style="font-style: italic;" >Sprachbund</span> that represents an intermediate stage between the reality of America and that of Spain and Portugal.
      </p>
      <p class="researcher_text"> The project I present here represents a turning point in my career and it aims to disseminate the linguistic, geographical, social and pragmatic dynamics that developed during the 18th and 19th centuries in the only area that possesses both American and European features. In the months to come, I will show the birth of the so-called Sprachbund as well as the formation of two clearly distinguishable areas on both sides of the Hispanic and Lusophone Atlantic, with the southwest as the epicentre of it all.
